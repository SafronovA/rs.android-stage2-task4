Task 4: Working with storage

The task is to create Database of cats/dogs/auto(anything you want)

You should show all items form your database in the recycler view on the main screen
After clicking "Add" button user should be redirected to "Add item screen" where he could add new item to the database
On the main screen user can click "Filter" button and go the the filter screen which is implemented using "PrefereneFragment"!
Optionally you can add Update and Delete functionality!
On the image you can see the mockups of all screens, it's not the exact design, so feel free to play with design and items :)
